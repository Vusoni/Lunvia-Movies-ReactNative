*Lunvia-Movies-ReactNative 🎬*

*Overview*

A React Native + TypeScript mobile application that consumes The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data. Built as part of my React Native learning journey — a sandbox to practice API integration, navigation, state management, styled components, and cross-platform mobile UI.

*Key Features*
	•	Browse lists of movies retrieved from TMDB (popular, trending, etc.)
	•	View detailed movie information (title, poster, synopsis, release date, genres, etc.)
	•	Search movies via TMDB API (if implemented)
	•	Cross-platform support (iOS & Android)
	•	Clean code structure with modular components, services and type safety (TypeScript + interfaces)

*Tech Stack & Libraries*
	•	React Native (TypeScript)
	•	Styling: NativeWind / Tailwind-style configuration via tailwind.config.js
	•	HTTP calls / API integration: services folder (TMDB API wrappers)
	•	Navigation: React Navigation / React Native navigation setup (via app/ structure)
	•	Project configuration: Babel, Metro, tsconfig — for type support & React Native build flow




*How to Run the App*
	1.	Download or clone the project repository
	2.	Install dependencies with npm install
	3.	Add your TMDB API key in a .env file
	4.	Start the app with npx expo start or react-native start
	5.	Run on iOS simulator, Android emulator, or Expo Go
